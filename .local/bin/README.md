## ALL MY SCRIPTS

**For XMonad and XMobar to work properly, all the listed scripts are required to be in the directory `$HOME/.local/bin`**

The results of all scripts are displayed in the xmobar using pipes

Some scripts use characters from [Font-Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) and [Weather Icons Font](https://github.com/erikflowers/weather-icons)

As an alternative to the Font-Awesome, you can use the [Terminus Re33 Nerd](https://github.com/Haron-Prime/My_config_files/blob/master/.fonts/TerminusRe33Nerd.ttf) - it contains the same set of symbols, but is based on the monospaced font Terminus Re33
